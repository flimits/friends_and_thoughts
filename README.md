Model User
- username
- email
- thoughts ( ref 'thought')
- friends ( ref 'User')
- virtual friendCount - going to have a function to calculate length of the FRIEND array.
Model Thought
- thoughtText
- createdAt
- username ( ref 'userId' )
- reaction ( array of reactionId references )
(doesn't have to be a model, has to be a schema)
- virtual reactionCount - going to have a function
to get the length of REACTIONS array
Schema Reaction
- Id
- body
- username
- createdAt
This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.
