# friends_and_thoughts

This API is to mimic the interactions between users and their friends in a Social Networking environment. 

## Description and Motivation

As a user, I would want to be able to add my username to a "Meet with Friends" - type Social media network so that I can share thoughts with them.
With this API, The user will be able to share and receive "thought" (comments from friends). They can also create a friends list, and manage the thoughts and friends by changing or deleting them.

### The following is a link to the video of the application's functionality:

### Just to see how it will look using Insomnia, here is a snippet of all users:

## Usage

Since this is an API, it is created with the user in mind who wishes to implement it. Simply do the following and you will be able to build and use this for yourself.

* First, clone this repo to your desktop somewhere.
* Next, you need to install the libraries and dependencies required to run it
  * cd <repo_location>
  * npm install
  * npm run start
* Your application will now run. All you will need to do is use something like Insomnia (or another app that can use this API) to interact with the application and add your user data there.

## Learning Points and Lessons learned

This was a great oportunity to learn Mongoose and Mongodb. I was excited to get it in place and start working on it

## Code Snippets

This is a typical server.js file, but adding db connection to the mongoDB server
```js
const express = require('express');
const db = require('./config/connection');
const routes = require('./routes');

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
const app = express();

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(routes);

db.once('open', () => {
  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`API server for running on port ${PORT}!`);
  });
});
```
We now set up our routes
```js
const router = require('express').Router();
const userRoutes = require('./userRoutes');
const thoughtRoutes = require('./thoughtRoutes');

router.use('/users', userRoutes);
router.use('/thoughts', thoughtRoutes);

module.exports = router;
```
Which will point to the locations of the user and thoughtRoutes.
<br>

Some key code would be how routes are set up differently for mongoose as opposed to sequelize. Here is for thoughts routing. All will be undfer /api/thoughts for GET, POST, DELETE
```js
const {
  getThoughts,
  createThought,
  findAThought,
  deleteAThought,
  updateAThought,
} = require('../../controllers/thought.js');

// /api/thought .. get all thought and create a thought
router.route('/').get(getThoughts).post(createThought);

// /api/thought as well, to get one thought or delete one thought by id
router.route('/:thoughtId').get(findAThought).delete(deleteAThought).put(updateAThought);
```
As an example for the modeling of mongoose, here is the Schema setup for users.
```js
const { Schema, model } = require('mongoose');

// Schema to create User model
const userSchema = new Schema(
  {
    username: {
      type: String,
      unique: true,
      required: true,
      trim: true,
    },
    email: {
      type: String,
      unique: true,
      required: true,
      match: [/.+@.+\..+/, 'Please enter a valid e-mail address'],
    },
    thoughts: [
      {
        type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Thought',
      },
    ],
    friends: [
      {
        type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'User',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    // Mongoose supports two Schema options to transform Objects after querying MongoDb: toJSON and toObject - Equivalent.
    // Here we are indicating that we want virtuals to be included with our response, overriding the default behavior
    toJSON: {
      virtuals: true,
    },
    id: false,
  }
);

userSchema.virtual('friendCount').get(function () {
  return `${this.friends.length}`;
});

NOTE: the requirments for mongoose. But also, it is similary to that of Sequelize.

# PSUEDO Coding out 18 NoSQL: Social Network API
1. Set up config - (make sure MONGOOSE connection are good).
2. Set up route directory with CONTROLLERS and ROUTES in it.
3. Set up Model directory
4. Set up Utils directory
5. Set up NPM - express , mongoose, nodemon --watch
6. Create Server.js
Model User
- username
- email
- thoughts ( ref 'thought')
- friends ( ref 'User')
- virtual friendCount - going to have a function to calculate length of the FRIEND array.
Model Thought
- thoughtText
- createdAt
- username ( ref 'userId' )
- reaction ( array of reactionId references )
(doesn't have to be a model, has to be a schema)
- virtual reactionCount - going to have a function
to get the length of REACTIONS array
Schema Reaction
- Id
- body
- username
- createdAt
This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.
API Routes
User route
- get 1 findOne({ })
- get all find({ })
- put findOneAndUpdate({ })
- create create(req.body)
- delete findOneAndDelete({ })
- POST findOneAndUpdate {$AddtoSet { }}
- DELETE for friend request findOneAndUpdate {$pull} {new True}
Thought route
- get 1
- get all
- put
- create
- delete
- ADD / DELETE Reaction
CONTROLLER
Interact with the model
modules.export = findAll(user)
ROUTES interact with the Database
render user
